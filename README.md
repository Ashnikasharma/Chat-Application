# Chat-Application
My project is a Chat Application created using Core Java, Java Swing , Java AWT and Socket Programming.Core Java provides the foundation for your applications while Java Swing and AWT are libraries in Java that provide tools for creating graphical user interfaces. Socket programming is used for network communication between different devices. With these technologies, you can create a chat application that allows users to send messages to each other over a network.

Features -
Some features of Chat application:
1. One-on-One Messaging: Allow users to send private messages to their friends.
2. File Sharing: Enable users to share files such as images, documents, or videos.
3. Message Search: Implement a search feature to help users find specific messages or conversations.
4. Message Encryption: Add an extra layer of security by encrypting messages to protect user privacy.
5. Offline Messaging: Allow users to send messages even when the recipient is offline, so they can read them later.

Technologies Used :
In a chat application created using core Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, and socket programming, you would primarily utilize Java for the backend logic. Java Swing and AWT would be used for designing the graphical user interface (GUI) components, such as buttons, text fields, and windows. Socket programming would allow for the establishment of network communication, enabling real-time messaging between users. This combination of technologies provides a solid foundation for building a chat application with a user-friendly interface and efficient communication.
